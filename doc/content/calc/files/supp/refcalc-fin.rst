refcalc-FIN
===========

Contains the input for the TensErLEED reference calculation.
Simply a collection of the data in :ref:`AUXLATGEO`, :ref:`BEAMLIST`, 
:ref:`AUXNONSTRUCT`, :ref:`PHASESHIFTS`,  :ref:`AUXBEAMS` and :ref:`AUXGEO`.

The refcalc-FIN file does not have to be in the folder for the reference
calculation to run, but rather is piped directly into TensErLEED from |calc|.
