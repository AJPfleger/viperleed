control.chem
============

The file ``control.chem`` is used internally be TensErLEED.
It is cleared and written anew for every generation of the genetic algorithm used by TensErLEED (see ref. :cite:t:`kottckeNewApproachAutomated1997`) and contains the current generation's parameters for all individuals.

** TODO: can we get rid of control.chem for performance? **
