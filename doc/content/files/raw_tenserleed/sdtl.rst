SD.TL
=====

The file ``SD.TL`` is the search output file generated by TensErLEED and is read repeatedly by :term:`tleedm` during the structure search to extract information on the progress of the search.
It contains the periodic output of the current state of all individuals in the search population (see parameter :ref:`SEARCH_POPULATION<searchpop>`).
The name ``SD.TL`` is used by convention and defined in the ``PARAM`` file.

The file is appended to by TensErLEED with information about the current last search generation at predefined intervals.
For every individual in the search population, ``SD.TL`` lists the current parameter-indices, best-fit real part of the inner potential and the corresponding R-factor.
