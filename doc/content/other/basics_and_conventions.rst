Basics and conventions
======================

Coordinate system
-----------------

The lattice vectors describing the unit cell are named **a**, **b**, and 
**c**. **a** and **b** must be in the xy plane, and **c** have a positive z component.
The +z direction is outwards from the surface.

Units
-----

All distances and vibration amplitudes are in Ångström, energies in eV.!!
