Hematite (102) 1x1
==================

Hematite (:math:`\alpha \text{-Fe}_2\text{O}_3`) is a very common iron oxide and a popular model system for (single-atom) catalysis :cite:p:`kraushoferAtomicscaleStructureHematite2018,franceschiModelSystemPhotocatalysis2020`.
The (102) surface exhibits two stable reconstructions under :term:`UHV` conditions; a stoicometric (1x1) bulk-terminated reconstruction and a reduced (2x2) reconstruction :cite:p:`kraushoferAtomicscaleStructureHematite2018`.
Here we use the bulk-terminated (1x1) reconstructed surface as an example system of a "medium complexity" surface and will compare experimental LEED :math:`I(V)` data with a theory calculation.


We start from experimental [#]_

We also use an existing :ref:`PHASESHIFTS file<phaseshifts>` and place it in the directory.

Let's run the initialization to check if all input files are interpreted correctly:
