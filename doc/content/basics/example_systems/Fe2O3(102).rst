.. _example_Fe2O3:

Hematite (012)-(1×1)
====================

Hematite (:math:`\alpha \text{-Fe}_2\text{O}_3`) is a very common iron oxide and a popular model system for (single-atom) catalysis :cite:p:`kraushoferAtomicscaleStructureHematite2018,franceschiModelSystemPhotocatalysis2020`.
The :math:`(1\bar{1}02)` surface (also referred to as :math:`(012)`) exhibits two stable terminations under :term:`UHV` conditions: a stoichiometric (1×1) bulk-truncated termination, and a reduced (2×1) reconstruction :cite:p:`kraushoferAtomicscaleStructureHematite2018`.
Here we use the bulk-truncated (1×1) surface as an example system of a "medium complexity" oxide surface and will compare experimental LEED :math:`I(V)` data with a theory calculation.


We start from experimental data [#]_ stored in an :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv file<expbeams>`.

We also use an existing :ref:`PHASESHIFTS file<phaseshifts>` and place it in the directory.

Let's run the initialization to check if all input files are interpreted correctly:


.. [#] The data was obtained by Alexander M. Imre and Michele Riva, with further support provided by Florian Kraushofer, Giada Franceschi, Tilman Kißlinger and Lutz Hammer. **TODO** add ORCID?; **TODO** refer to ViPErLEED paper where we put it as SI (if that is still the plan?)
