Introduction
============

**TODO Lutz:** It would be nice if we could put one to three LEED patterns of the system here.  I can't take them directly from the paper for legal reasons – but since you are the author, you could send me the original ones ;)

We have a set of 79 beams available in our energy range.
They correspond to a total energy range of around 17500 eV which we can use, of which only around 1800 eV are from integer beams.
The Tellurim coverage is 0.40 mono-layers – 4 Tellurim atoms per surface unit cell.

For our example analysis we start from a qualitatively correct structure model with correct layer stacking :cite:p:`kisslingerSubmonolayerCopperTelluride2021`.
However, the initial atom positions in the POSCAR are taken from bulk Copper, so we need to expect significant relaxation during the structure-optimization.
We will need to run multiple delta
The individual :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS files<displacements>` are not all shown in full below, but you can download all input files here.

**TODO** show structure?

PARAMETERS and rough DISPLACEMENTS
==================================

Similar to the previous examples, we start by setting up a :ref:`PARAMETERS file<parameters>` file:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Cu-Te/PARAMETERS
   :language: console
   :caption: PARAMETERS

Most of the used parameters have been explained in :ref:`previous examples<example_ag_100>`.
Worth mentioning in this particular case is that we use :ref:`SITE_DEF<sitedef>` to define two topmost Copper and Tellurim atoms as explicit surface sites.
We further ...

As usual, :ref:`IVBEAMS<ivbeams>` and :ref:`PHASESHIFTS<phaseshifts>` are generated automatically during initialization.
The :ref:`VIBROCC file<viboccin>` will also be generated by ViPErLEED based on :ref:`T_DEBYE<t_debye>`, :ref:`T_EXPERIMENT<t_experiment>`, and :ref:`VIBR_AMP_SCALE<VIBR_AMP_SCALE>`.
