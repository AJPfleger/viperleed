Example System: Ag(100)
=======================

In this section, we go through setting up and executing a simple ViPErLEED calculation using the example of the Ag(100)-(1x1) surface.\ [#]_
If this is your first time running ViPErLEED, first make sure to follow the :ref:`installation instructions<installation>`.

Initialization Run
==================

To start off...

Let's have a look at the :ref:`PARAMETERS file<parameters>`:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Ag(100)/PARAMETERS
   :language: console
   :caption: PARAMETERS

Since we only want to to run the :ref:`initialization` for now, we set :ref:`RUN = 0<run>`.
For this example, we also limit our energy range to 50-350 eV, with a step of 3 eV (:ref:`THEO_ENERGIES<theo_energies>`).

We give some infomation on how ViPErLEED should interpret the structure given in the :ref:`POSCAR file<poscar>`.
Using :ref:`N_BULK_LAYERS<blay>` and :ref:`BULK_REPEAT<bulk_repeat>`, we specify the bulk material below the surface.
See the pages of those parameters for more details.

With the :ref:`SITE_DEF<sitedef>` command, we further define that the top-most atom (#1 in the POSCAR) should be treated as a distinct different species.
See the page on the :ref:`SITE_DEF<sitedef>` parameter for details on how this works, and see also the notes on :ref:`avoiding element name collisions<elementnamecollision>`.

In addition to the atomic positions, the calculation of scattering-intensities also requires vibrational amplitudes for every atom in the unit cell.
While the atomic positions are contained in the :ref:`POSCAR file<poscar>`, the vibrational amplitudes are given in the :ref:`VIBROCC file<viboccin>`.
However, rather than writing the :ref:`VIBROCC file<viboccin>` ourselvs, we can also let ViPErLEED make an educated guess about the vibrational amplitudes by providing the parameters :ref:`T_DEBYE<t_debye>`, :ref:`T_EXPERIMENT<t_experiment>`, and :ref:`VIBR_AMP_SCALE<VIBR_AMP_SCALE>`.

Finally, in the :ref:`PARAMETERS file<parameters>` above we already specified the parameters :ref:`V0_IMAG<v0_imag>` and :ref:`LMAX` for the reference calculation.
These set the imaginary part of the inner potential and the maxium angular momentum quantum number to be used in the calculations.

Once the run finishes, we can have a look at the :ref:`log file<log_files_tleedm>` to see if everything went as expected.
Unless there was some configuration error, the log should now contain some lines like this:

.. code-block:: console

   ...
   Found unit cell type: square
   Starting symmetry search...
   Found plane group: p4m
   Checking bulk unit cell...
   Found SUPERLATTICE = (1x1)
   ...

As expected, ViPErLEED recognized our surface be of p4m symmetry with a simple (1x1) reconstruction!

With this done, we can now continue to run the actuall scattering calculations.

Reference Calculation and R-factor
==================================

Since we already added the parameters relating to the :ref:`reference-calculation<ref-calc>` in the previous step, we can just start the calculation again, after setting :ref:`RUN = 1<run>` to select the :ref:`reference-calculation<ref-calc>`.

Note, that the initialization will still be automatically excuted at the start of every ViPErLEED run.
Similarly, if an :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv files<expbeams>` is provided as is the case here, the :ref:`R-factor calculation<rfactor>` will be inserted automatically after the reference-calculation.

Once the reference-calculation finishes (only takes about 30 seconds with the chosen settings) we find a result for the R-factor at the very end of the :ref:`log file<log_files_tleedm>`:

.. code-block:: console

   ...
   Total elapsed time: 30.21 seconds

   Executed segments: 0 1 11
   Final R (refcalc): 0.1722

Addionally, in the :ref:`OUT directory<dir_organization_output>`, we find a file :ref:`THEOBEAMS.csv<theobeams>` which contains the calculated theoretical :math:`I(V)` curves and a file :ref:`Rfactor_analysis_refcalc.pdf<rfactorplots>` in which the experimental and theoretical beams are plotted.
The latter should look something like this:

.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Ag(100)/refalc_result_plot.png
   :width: 450px
   :align: center

   Rfactor_analysis_refcalc.pdf


The :math:`I(V)` curves clearly show a good qualitative agreement, but the R-factor of ~0.17 is not great for such a simple system!
We therfore proceed to the :ref:`delta-amplitudes<sec-deltas>` calculation and the :ref:`structure-search<sec-search>`.
