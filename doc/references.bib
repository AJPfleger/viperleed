  abstract = {The quantitative analysis of intensity spectra from low energy electron diffraction is today's most widely used technique for the extraction of detailed surface crystallographic information. The Erlangen Tensor LEED package TensErLEED provides an efficient computer code for the fast computation of LEED intensity spectra from virtually any periodic surface. For the full dynamic reference calculation, standard methods such as the muffin-tin approach and the layer stacking method are used. Amplitude changes in Tensor LEED are accessible for geometric, vibrational and chemical displacements from the reference structure. The package also contains a structural search algorithm designed for the retrieval of the global R-factor minimum between calculated and measured intensity spectra within a given portion of the parameter space using Tensor LEED.},

  abstract = {We present a new structural search concept for low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) intensity analyses. It combines the advantages of an efficient automated optimization scheme with rapid access to model intensity data by tensor LEED. The geometrical, chemical and thermal versions of the latter method are employed to calculate the diffraction amplitudes for structures deviating from a certain preselected reference by atomic shifts, chemical occupation of lattice sites and both isotropic and anisotropic atomic vibrations. The automated optimization of the theory-experiment fit results from a modified random sampling algorithm, which scales as N2.5 with N the number of parameters, turning out to be a good compromise between global and local search methods. Using simulated intensity spectra for the Ir(110)-(2 \texttimes{} 1) missing-row reconstructed surface as pseudo-experimental data, we test and demonstrate the reliability of the new procedure and its efficiency. Also, we successfully apply the algorithm to real experimental data of two different surface phases of FeAl(100) and to data of Mo0.95Re0.05(100)-c(2 \texttimes{} 2)-C as examples for multi-parameter fits.},

In many cases the linear dependence on the structure factor gives computational savings approaching 103 over conventional methods.},

  abstract = {The amplitude-phase representation (APR) [W. E. Milne, Phys. Rev. 35, 863 (1930)] is applied to the relativistic radial Schr\"odinger equation corresponding to the Dirac equations with central potential. The initial conditions, hitherto unspecified, for the nonlinear second-order amplitude equation at the finite radius of a muffin-tin (MT) sphere are established by a semiconvergent method. This opens the possibility of using APR for the calculation of electron scattering phase shifts with a finite MT radius as well as with a large atomic radius, whereby the first wave node is phase of reference equal to a multiple of {$\pi$}, adding nothing to the phase shifts. Furthermore, APR is used for benchmarking wave functions obtained by ordinary differential equation integration of the Dirac equations up to high energy and high orbital quantum number. The present APR procedure is discussed with reference to earlier numerical methods. To complete the physical picture, the paper ends with a discussion on exchange-correlation dependent scattering potential in MT spheres of optimized radii, a crystal potential model whose dependence on radii and energy dependent inner potential has recently been corroborated by low energy electron diffraction in oxides with many atoms per unit cell.},

The model is conceived for elastic electron scattering in a surface slab with exchange-correlation interaction described by the local density approximation. The model employs two data bases for the self-energy of the signal electron (after Hedin and Lundqvist or Sernelius). The potential model is discussed in detail with two surface structures Be(101\textasciimacron 0), for which SCLS's are available, and Cu(111)p(2\texttimes 2)Cs, in which the close-packed radii of the atoms are extremely different. It is considered plausible that tensor LEED based on an optimized MT potential can be used for determining SCLS's.},

The layer concentrations known to be 100\% Rh are reproduced with a maximum error of 8\% when the Pendry R-factor (RP) is employed.
