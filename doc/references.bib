  abstract = {The quantitative analysis of intensity spectra from low energy electron diffraction is today's most widely used technique for the extraction of detailed surface crystallographic information. The Erlangen Tensor LEED package TensErLEED provides an efficient computer code for the fast computation of LEED intensity spectra from virtually any periodic surface. For the full dynamic reference calculation, standard methods such as the muffin-tin approach and the layer stacking method are used. Amplitude changes in Tensor LEED are accessible for geometric, vibrational and chemical displacements from the reference structure. The package also contains a structural search algorithm designed for the retrieval of the global R-factor minimum between calculated and measured intensity spectra within a given portion of the parameter space using Tensor LEED.},

  abstract = {We present a new structural search concept for low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) intensity analyses. It combines the advantages of an efficient automated optimization scheme with rapid access to model intensity data by tensor LEED. The geometrical, chemical and thermal versions of the latter method are employed to calculate the diffraction amplitudes for structures deviating from a certain preselected reference by atomic shifts, chemical occupation of lattice sites and both isotropic and anisotropic atomic vibrations. The automated optimization of the theory-experiment fit results from a modified random sampling algorithm, which scales as N2.5 with N the number of parameters, turning out to be a good compromise between global and local search methods. Using simulated intensity spectra for the Ir(110)-(2 \texttimes{} 1) missing-row reconstructed surface as pseudo-experimental data, we test and demonstrate the reliability of the new procedure and its efficiency. Also, we successfully apply the algorithm to real experimental data of two different surface phases of FeAl(100) and to data of Mo0.95Re0.05(100)-c(2 \texttimes{} 2)-C as examples for multi-parameter fits.},

By making one full dynamical calculation for a reference structure we express diffraction from modifications of this structure in first-order perturbation theory. This gives a theory analogous to the x-ray case in that it can be separated into a structure factor and a form factor which is a tensor in the dynamical regime. In many cases the linear dependence on the structure factor gives computational savings approaching 103 over conventional methods.},

Tensor LEED is a perturbative approach to the calculation of LEED I \textendash{} V spectra in which an initial reference surface is distorted to generate a particular trial structure. If these atomic displacements are small then we can use a first order perturbation theory to calculate the resultant changes in the LEED I \textendash{} V spectra. This leads to a highly efficient calculational technique which can reduce the computational effort expended upon a typical structure determination by several orders of magnitude.},

By using the MT radii as adjustable parameters the model is able to conserve the definition of the SCLS with respect to the bulk and concurrently to generate a potential that is continuous at the MT radii. The model is conceived for elastic electron scattering in a surface slab with exchange-correlation interaction described by the local density approximation. The model employs two data bases for the self-energy of the signal electron (after Hedin and Lundqvist or Sernelius). The potential model is discussed in detail with two surface structures Be(101\textasciimacron 0), for which SCLS's are available, and Cu(111)p(2\texttimes 2)Cs, in which the close-packed radii of the atoms are extremely different. It is considered plausible that tensor LEED based on an optimized MT potential can be used for determining SCLS's.},

We analyse experimental I(E) spectra of pure Rh(111) for its known chemical composition by comparing them to calculations assuming a substitutionally disordered PtxRh1-x alloy surface. The layer concentrations known to be 100\% Rh are reproduced with a maximum error of 8\% when the Pendry R-factor (RP) is employed. This error is considerably smaller than estimated by error bars derived from the variance of RP. We argue that the same accuracy can be expected for compositional depth profiles to be determined for alloys exhibiting weak chemical order and negligible lattice distortions such as PtxRh1-x.},
