  abstract = {The quantitative analysis of intensity spectra from low energy electron diffraction is today's most widely used technique for the extraction of detailed surface crystallographic information. The Erlangen Tensor LEED package TensErLEED provides an efficient computer code for the fast computation of LEED intensity spectra from virtually any periodic surface. For the full dynamic reference calculation, standard methods such as the muffin-tin approach and the layer stacking method are used. Amplitude changes in Tensor LEED are accessible for geometric, vibrational and chemical displacements from the reference structure. The package also contains a structural search algorithm designed for the retrieval of the global R-factor minimum between calculated and measured intensity spectra within a given portion of the parameter space using Tensor LEED.},

Structural conclusions are essentially identical from both approaches. Advantages of the Pendry approach include its much shorter times for computation, and its tendency to give lower uncertainties for the interlayer spacing.},

By making one full dynamical calculation for a reference structure we express diffraction from modifications of this structure in first-order perturbation theory. This gives a theory analogous to the x-ray case in that it can be separated into a structure factor and a form factor which is a tensor in the dynamical regime. In many cases the linear dependence on the structure factor gives computational savings approaching 103 over conventional methods.},

Tensor LEED is a perturbative approach to the calculation of LEED I \textendash{} V spectra in which an initial reference surface is distorted to generate a particular trial structure. If these atomic displacements are small then we can use a first order perturbation theory to calculate the resultant changes in the LEED I \textendash{} V spectra. This leads to a highly efficient calculational technique which can reduce the computational effort expended upon a typical structure determination by several orders of magnitude.},

We analyse experimental I(E) spectra of pure Rh(111) for its known chemical composition by comparing them to calculations assuming a substitutionally disordered PtxRh1-x alloy surface. The layer concentrations known to be 100\% Rh are reproduced with a maximum error of 8\% when the Pendry R-factor (RP) is employed. This error is considerably smaller than estimated by error bars derived from the variance of RP. We argue that the same accuracy can be expected for compositional depth profiles to be determined for alloys exhibiting weak chemical order and negligible lattice distortions such as PtxRh1-x.},
