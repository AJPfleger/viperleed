    For both ADCs, the channel currently selected is calibrated
    for all the possible gain values. The calibration results
    are stored, so that they can be fetched later for faster
    gain switching.

    Currently, each gain value is done over a separate state-loop.
    This means that it takes approximately 360 ms to finish a single
    run of this function (120 ms x 3 points for computing medians).
    This means, the serial line remains unresponsive for ~360 ms.
    TODO: We should consider whether we rather want to run one single
    median point per state-loop. This would leave the serial line
    inactive only for 120 ms.

    The calibration is done in parallel for both ADCs (if present).

    This function needs to be called again should the updateRate
    to be used for the measurements change. Since this takes quite
    long to complete (~3s for all the gains), it is advisable not
    to run it when finding the best ADC gain (don at 500Hz), since
    there the measurements are done at gain==0 and only for the
    channel to be measured.
