C  MNBED  : number of beams in experimental spectra before averaging
C  MNBTD  : number of beams in theoretical spectra before averaging

      PARAMETER (MNBED = 57, MNBTD = 57)

C  MNET   : number of energies in theoretical beam at time of reading in
C  MNGP  : greater equal number of grid points in energy working grid (ie after
C           interpolation)
C  MNS    : number of geometries including those, that are skipped

      PARAMETER (MNET = 246, MNGP = 1618)
      PARAMETER (MNS = 1)

C  MNGAP  : number of gaps in the experimental spectra (NOTE: if there are no
C           gaps in the spectra set MNGAP to 1 to avoid zero-sized arrays)

      PARAMETER (MNGAP = 1)
